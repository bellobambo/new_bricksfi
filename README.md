# `Bricksfi` üè¢üí∞

**BricksFi** is a decentralized real estate investment platform built on the Internet Computer (ICP). This Motoko canister enables fractional property investment, letting users invest ICP tokens into tokenized properties while tracking funding, yields, and ownership transparently on-chain.

Welcome to your new `new_bricksfi` project and the Internet Computer development community! This README provides essential instructions for local development, deployment, and understanding the project structure.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Property Management** ‚Äì Create, update, and track properties with bedrooms, bathrooms, square meters, location, images, and total price in ICP.
- **Investment Tracking** ‚Äì Users can invest ICP in properties, view funding progress, and track personal investments.
- **Admin Controls** ‚Äì Only the owner can delete properties or withdraw funds.
- **Secure ICP Transfers** ‚Äì Handles ledger transfers safely with built-in fees and error handling.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Local Development

```bash
# Start the local replica in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploy backend and frontend canisters
dfx deploy new_bricksfi_backend --argument '(principal "2vxsx-fae")'
dfx deploy new_bricksfi_frontend
```

- Access your app locally at: `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`
- To regenerate the Candid interface after backend changes:

```bash
npm run generate
```

- To run the frontend development server:

```bash
npm start
```

---

### Mainnet Deployment

```bash
# Deploy backend to the Internet Computer
dfx deploy --network ic --argument '(principal "YOUR_PRINCIPAL_HERE")'

# Deploy frontend
dfx deploy --network ic new_bricksfi_frontend
```

- Check your principal:

```bash
dfx identity get-principal
```

If you want, I can also **add a small section showing example Motoko calls** (`createProperty`, `investInProperty`, `getAllProperties`) to make it more GitHub-friendly for developers.

Do you want me to add that?
